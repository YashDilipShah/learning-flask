# learning-flask
This is the repository where I am keeping all the files related to the work I am doing currently. 

This repository contains the code from Udemy course of Teclado, REST APIs with Flask. Also, this will contain all the 
files that I will be creating for learning flask. 

This is just for study purpose, but if you are anyone other than me, looking at this repo, 
please, do not judge me :)
